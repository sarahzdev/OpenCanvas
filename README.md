# OpenCanvas: A Platform for AI Art üé®

**‚ö°Ô∏è Looking for collaborators and beta testers interested in defining machine-enhanced digital co-creation.**

Make your mark on an open, permanent digital canvas. Craft, share, and remix AI-generated art.

OpenCanvas is:
- Powered by AI: Use state-of-the-art AI models to bring your imagination to life.
- Backed by distributed storage: Your creations are preserved and only a click away.
- Chronicled on-chain: Your artistry is verifiably traceable.
- Collaborative at heart: Get inspired and work with fellow artizens.

## üß± MVP Roadmap

1. ERC721 smart contract for the AI artwork
Each art piece will be a non-fungible token (NFT).

2. Integration with a secure non-custodial wallet provider
Onboarding onto the platform should be as seamless as signing in with social.

3. Integration with a decentralized storage provider
An art piece and its associated metadata (e.g., prompt, model used, and date) will be securely stored on a decentralized platform.
   
4. UX/UI for core experiences, which includes:
- Generating AI art using prompts
- Minting an art piece
- Showcasing art pieces
- Remixing an art piece
